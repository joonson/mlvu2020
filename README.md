### Overview

The notebooks should be run in Colab. 

The tutorial is intended to walk you through the process of solving a problem using machine learning.

- Curating a dataset
  - Make a list of search queries
  - Perform the search and download the data
  - Filter the data using a semi-automatic process
  - Combine the data with what others have collected
- Train and validate the models in PyTorch
- Test the model in PyTorch
- Convert the PyTorch model to TF Lite
- Deploy and test the model on the Coral device
- Write a [technical report](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.robots.ox.ac.uk%2F~joon%2Fshared%2FK_Celeb.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFdjrPtK8ghup7aeGGI8m9hmSQUHA)
