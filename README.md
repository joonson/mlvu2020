 Machine Learning for Visual Understanding @ SNU GSDS

### Overview

The notebooks should be run in Colab. 

The exercise is intended to walk you through the process of solving a problem using machine learning.

- Curating a dataset
  - Make a list of search queries
  - Perform the search and download the data
  - Filter the data using a semi-automatic process
  - Combine the data with what others have collected
- Test the final model
- Train and validate the models in PyTorch
- Test the model in PyTorch
- Port the PyTorch model to TF Lite
- Deploy and test the model on the Coral device
